Glad Vaxt Custom Theme

Notes for Joel and Paul:
I very much enjoyed making this custom theme, I chain-drank a lot of tea and felt very much in-the-zone.

General Notes:

With more time I would have continued with:
Adding in facebook and twitter logos in the footer
Finishing responsive styling on small screens
Including custom hamburger icon/making main nav
