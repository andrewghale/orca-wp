Glad Vaxt Custom Theme

Notes for Joel and Paul:

General Notes:

With more time I would have continued with:
Adding in facebook and twitter logos in the footer
Finishing responsive styling on small screens
Including custom hamburger icon/making main nav
Adding in the small crescent/dot elements and work on parallax
Added hover transitions on buttons/icons

Notes for self:
Remove node_modules and add .git-ignore
Finish speech bubbles
Add insta background-image in plant speech bubble
