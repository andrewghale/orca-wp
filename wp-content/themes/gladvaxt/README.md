Glad Vaxt Custom Theme for Orca

Really enjoyed this project, definitely felt in-the-zone while building it!

General Notes:
With more time I would have continued with:

Adding in facebook and twitter logos in the footer
Finishing responsive styling on small screens
Fixing image positioning on small screen on plant of the week section and splash section
Adding in the small crescent/dot elements and work on parallax
Added hover transitions on buttons/icons
Finish speech bubbles
Implementing some sort of max-width for the site
Create rem variable for common vertical spacings
Fix hamburger menu bug

Notes for self:
Remove node_modules and add .git-ignore
